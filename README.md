# Scion-Character-Sheet
A character sheet web application that I built for a mythology-themed tabletop roleplaying game.  The README has instructions for its use.

HELPFUL DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE
This game in particular resolved task conflicts with dice rolls, typically taking two different traits (an attribute and a skill), combining their values, and then rolling that many 10-sided dice.  Each 10-sided die that comes up with a result of a 7, 8, 9, or 0 counts as a "success" (with one typically being the minimum required and more sometimes being needed). 

PROBLEM STATEMENT
As the game's power scale increased, the number of dice that players had to roll in order to get anything done became prohibitive to smooth game play.  

SOLUTION
The application records the character's traits, derives dice totals from those traits, and generates a result from that dice total for any given combination of traits without any physical dice needing to be rolled.
